<h1>TextSpam</h1>

An android app to spam someone with text messages.

Update 05/04/2015: As of Today TextSpam was taken off of the Play Store. After
reaching over 100,000 users I am proud to say that a simple joke became one of
my proudest accomplishments. To whomever downloaded the application,
I sincerely thank you; I wouldn't have ever been able to reach such a milestone
without your support.

No matter what Google does, they cannot erase TextSpam. The application will
live on in the Amazon App Store and the source code will remain open in the
name of Free Software.
